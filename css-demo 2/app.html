				<h1 id="weboverview"> Overview of <b>the Web</b></h1>

			<div>


					<p>The main type of documents on the web are made with a language called <em>HTML</em>.
					<em>HTML</em> stands for <em>"Hypertext Markup Language"</em>. Another types of documents we can find on the web are: PDF, images, plain text, videos, music and basically anything you like.</p>
				
					<p><br>To understand what <b>"the web"</b> is, we can break it up in parts:</p>
 				 	
  					

  					<p>1) <em>Your computer + browser</em>: A browser is a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web. e.g. Google Chrome, Firefox, others.<br>
  					2) <em>The internet</em>: is the world's larger computer network.<br>
  					3)<em>HTTP</em>: is the main protocol of the web, used by your computer to communicate with the servers. <br>
  					4) <em>Servers</em>: are big computers hosting the files that make up the web.<br><br></p>

  					<p>How does it work?<br>

 				 	<p>Your computer (through your favorite browser) makes requests via the internet to the server, using a protocol called <em>HTTP</em>. After that, the server responds with files that your browser displays in your computer. <br>

					This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480496"> video</a> explains very well this process.<br></p>
		


					<p><b>Before continuing is important for you to know the following:</b>: <br><br>

					-How coding works: coding is a language we use to communicate with computers.
					<br><br>
					- Computers are stupid: this means programmers should write exactly what the computer understands. Otherwise, there will be problems with its function. 
					<br><br>
					-Programmers can't remember everything: don't feel bad if you can't remember how to type something. You can always look it up! :).</p>

				<h1 id="languages"> Three Languages used in Front End Development</h1>


					<p> There are three languages used to build websites: <b>HTML, CSS and Java Script</b>. Each language has specific purposes: if you think of a website like it was your house, the <em> HTML </em> language would be the structure of the house; <em> the CSS language </em>would be the style of your house, for example: the color of your walls; and the <em>Javascript</em> language would be the interactive component, such as the remote control. </p>

				<h1 id="HTML"> HTML</h1>

		
					<p><em>HTML</em> stands for <em>"Hypertext Markup Language"</em>. It is basically <em>"The heart of the Web"</em>.</p>
					
					<p><em>HTML</em> is made of: 

					1. Text content: is what you see.<br>
					2. Markup: what it looks like.<br>
					3. References to other documents.e.g: images + videos.<br>
					4. Links to other pages<br></p>
					
					<p>HTML Markup is made of tags. To understand this better, refer to <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444">this video</a></p>
					
					
					<p>Its basic structure is the following: &#60; tag &#62; content &#60;/tag&#62; </p>

 					<p><em>-Tags:</em>Tags are always contained within angle brackets. Most of them have an opening and a closing tag. Some of them doesn't require a closing tag (called void tags).</p>
 					<p> For an example of a tag watch <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48011976/m-48703273">this video</a></p>
					<p><em>-Content:</em> could be other tags or just text.</p>

					<p><em>-Elements</em>: the structure (&#60; tag &#62; content &#60;/tag&#62;) is called an element. But sometimes a tag might be called an element as well. </p>

					<p><em>-HTML Attributes:</em></p>

					<p>These are properties of an <em>HTML element</em>. It has the following structure:</p>

					<p><em> &#60;tag &#62; atribute = "atributes value" - contents &#60; /tag &#62;</em></p>
					
					<p>For an example of how to use <em>"attributes"</em> watch <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48508417/m-48723411">this video.</a></p>


				<h1 id="tree"> The Tree-Like structure</h1>

					<p><br>Imagine that the structure of a page is like a tree. There are main branches that give smaller branches, which as the same time give other much smaller branches and so on.

					<br><em>HTML</em> is the language that controls the structure of a web page and has a similar behaviour as the one described above, the only difference is that the chart is generally upside down compared to an actual tree.

					<br>How to create the tree?

			 		<br> Each HTML tag creates and element in the tree that the browser uses to display the page. In other words, tags help the web developer to create the structure of any content according to its hierarchical nature, and it is finally interpreted by the browser in a graphical form.

			 		<br> Sometimes you will hear the word DOM which is the same thing that tree-like structure.</p>



				<h1 id="box"> Everything is a box</h1>


					<p>Everything on a Webpage is realy a box! Why? because it makes life much easier!

					Every front end developer, designs its page based on a square model. This means that visual elements are contained inside boxes, even a circle! 

					In fact, front end developers, boxify their designs. 

					How they do it?

					It starts with the big box that is your page and from there, they split it piece by piece, from big to small, from: titles, images to footer elements.

					It is finally, as simple as sketching your design out and then drawing boxes with a pencil.</p>


				<h1 id="tools"> Programming Tools</h1>

					<p>There are text editors for programmers. These are programs similar to document editors (such as Microsoft Word), but without all the extra formatting functions that this programs generally have. Three of this text editors ( from easy to difficult to use) are: Scratchpad.io; Codepen.io and Sublime Text.</p>

					<p> If you would like to use of or all of them, refered to this links:</p>

						<p>This is a link for scratchpad: http://scratchpad.io/thankful-disease-2334</p>

						<p>This is a link for codepen: "http://codepen.io/ </p>

						<p>This is a link for sublime text: http://www.sublimetext.com/2">sublime text</p>

		
					<p>There are other sites in the web for valuable help with HTML, CSS, Javascript and others: </p>

						<p>This is a link to Mozilla Developer Network: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/> </p>

						<p>And this one to CSS tricks: https://css-tricks.com/ </p>

					

					<p>And always, off course, is the Google search engine.</p>


				<h1 id="tips"> Quick and Dirty Tips to create a Webpage </h1>

					<p>There is a very helpful way to learn more about webpage design. In Google Chrome, select any site (could be your favorite one!). Then select the three line icone in the upper right of your screen (next to the search engine). If you select tools, another set of options displays. Then select, developer tools. After that, an additional, panel will appear. In this panel you can see the structure of the page as the browser interprets it. If you click on the triangles, the structure expands and you can go deeper and deeper into this tree-like structure. In general, you can see that all elements are rectangular and you can read the same text as on the page, if you go deep enough in the structure.

					There is also a different panel called <em>"styles"</em>from where you can see CSS coding and another one called <em>"source"</em> from where you can see both. <em>HTML and CSS</em> languages.

					You can play with the parameters of the page as much as you like. This is a fun way to explore and learn the languages.</p>



				<h1 id="CSS"> CSS </h1>

					<p>CSS is the language of "styling". It allows you to use specific syntax and rules to define how elements appear in a page. For example, you can define: borders, font sizes, colors, position of objects, alignments, margins, backrounds, and so on.</p>

					<p> CSS stands for <em> Cascading Style Sheets</em>. The name is based on the idea of avoiding repetition. In this way, the most specific rule is applied to everything. In order to achieve this, you first have to make use of <em>selectors</em>. For example, a tag can be use as a <em>selector</em>. Elements with a particular tag, can be then styled, leaving out elements that doesn't have one. For the latter, a default configuration is applied.</p>
